### **Description**

This is a web app that allows users to contribute valuable data to AI models in a crowd source way. Like traditional crowd sourcing apps, users gain points as they contributions of which the value depends on the type of contribution. As they earn points they advance in levels and earn badges.

The app is built to be very similar to google crowdsource, but the key difference with Crowdsource by [NSK.AI](http://NSK.AI) is that it is a [Dapp](http://dapp.ai). The points users earn are directly stored on the blockchain and are equivalent to the Crowdsource Token. Badges are also not just mere jpegs, but NFTs.

Traditional AI crowdsourcing apps and sites do not reward users with cashable value. So the aim of this Project is to provide a platform where underrepresented datasets in the AI space can be sourced and fed to ML models, while rewarding users properly.
